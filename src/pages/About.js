          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I am a Senior Software Engineer with 11 years of experience in iOS, macOS, and Android development, known for my problem-solving mindset, ownership, and ability to deliver impactful solutions independently. Throughout my career, I have consistently taken initiative, solved complex technical challenges, and driven projects forward with minimal oversight.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Infoblox, I played a key role in developing and enhancing the BloxOne Mobile Roaming Client for iOS, Android, macOS, and Linux. I successfully integrated VPN functionality, MDM support, and optimized network routing using C++ and Golang, ensuring security and high performance. I also managed App Store and Play Store releases, taking full ownership of deployment and maintenance. When challenges arose, I proactively identified and implemented solutions without waiting for directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, at i-exceed, I not only led iOS development for the Appzillon platform but also took responsibility for solving deep-rooted technical issues, reducing app load times by 50%, fixing 400+ legacy bugs, and implementing advanced cryptographic techniques that eliminated security vulnerabilities. My ability to quickly learn, adapt, and optimize workflows significantly improved product stability and security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond corporate work, I thrive on self-driven projects, having developed and published multiple applications, explored browser extensions, and worked on freelance projects to continuously sharpen my skills. I take initiative, identify problems before they escalate, and drive solutions that have a lasting impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in getting things done, making decisions that move projects forward, and continuously improving my craft. Letâ€™s build something exceptional together. ðŸš€
